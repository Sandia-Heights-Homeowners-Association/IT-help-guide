# Overview

This is the main orientation page for SHHA volunteers.

You do not need to be technical to use this guide.

Most volunteers are added as **external Microsoft users** and do **not** need a paid Microsoft license.

If you feel stuck, confused, or locked out, that is normal.

Contact: **ITHelp@sandiahomeowners.org**

## What System Does SHHA Use?

SHHA primarily uses **Microsoft 365** for:

- Committee mailing lists
- Shared inboxes (officer roles)
- File storage (SharePoint)
- Internal collaboration

You may also see Google Calendar references for Board scheduling.

## Do I Need a New Microsoft Account?

No. Use the same email address that received your SHHA invitation.

When first added, you receive a Microsoft invitation email and must accept it once.

After acceptance, you can:

- Access committee SharePoint files
- Receive group emails
- Open shared documents

If access fails, the most common cause is that the original invitation was never accepted.

## Committee Mailing Lists (Microsoft Groups)

Each SHHA committee has a mailing list so one address reaches the whole committee.

Typical flow:

1. Committee chair informs office staff.
2. Office invites volunteer as an external Microsoft user.
3. Volunteer accepts Microsoft invitation.
4. Volunteer is added to committee mailing list.

Invitation emails may mention Teams or other services. You can ignore those references.

## Committee SharePoint Sites (Where Files Live)

Each committee has a SharePoint site that acts as its long-term file cabinet and working library.

Important: SharePoint navigation through Microsoft menus is often confusing.

Use the direct SharePoint links provided in committee materials or this help guide.

## File Sharing Rule (Most Important)

Do not try to share files directly with committee groups when members are external users.

Instead:

1. Upload the file to SharePoint.
2. Use **Share** or **Copy Link**.
3. Send the link to the committee mailing list.

Always share the link, not a stand-alone attachment for long-term committee docs.

## Shared Role Inboxes (Officers)

Officer mailboxes stay with the role, not the person.

Examples include:

- president@sandiahomeowners.org
- vicepresident@sandiahomeowners.org
- secretary@sandiahomeowners.org
- treasurer@sandiahomeowners.org

Best practice for SHHA business: reply from the shared role inbox, or CC it, so records are preserved.

## Board Materials and Calendar

- Board materials should be uploaded directly to Board SharePoint.
- Board meeting reminders are sent from a shared Google Calendar automation.

If reminders are missing, contact office staff or ITHelp.

## Record-Keeping and Archive

All committee mailing lists include an archival account for retention.

The archive inbox is not monitored and does not reply.
