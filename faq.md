# FAQ

Frequently asked questions for SHHA volunteers.

---

## I was invited but cannot access files. What is usually wrong?

The most common cause is that the original Microsoft invitation email was never accepted. Until you accept that invitation, Microsoft does not recognize you as an authorized guest, so SharePoint links and group emails will not work.

**How to fix it — step by step:**

1. **Search your email** (Gmail, Yahoo Mail, iCloud Mail, etc.) for a message from **"Microsoft Invitations"** with the subject line *"You've been invited to access applications within the Sandia Homeowners organization"* (or similar wording). Check your **Spam / Junk** folder — these invitations often land there.
2. **Open the email** and click the **"Accept invitation"** button or link.
3. **Sign in with your personal email address** — the same one the invitation was sent to. If you already have a Microsoft account linked to that email, use its password. If you do not have a Microsoft account, Microsoft will walk you through creating one (it is free) or will send you a one-time passcode to verify your identity.
4. **Review and accept the permissions prompt.** Microsoft will ask you to agree that SHHA can see basic profile information (your name and email). Click **Accept**.
5. **Try opening your SharePoint link again.** It should now work.

If you cannot find the invitation email or the link has expired, contact **ITHelp@sandiahomeowners.org** and they can resend it.

## Do I need a paid Microsoft license?

**Usually no.**

Most SHHA volunteers are added as **external guest users** in Microsoft 365. Guest access is free — you do not need to purchase Microsoft 365, and SHHA does not need to buy a license for you.

As a guest you can:
- Receive committee group emails at your personal email address
- Open and edit documents shared with you on SharePoint
- View files in your web browser without installing any software

The only people who need paid Microsoft 365 licenses are SHHA office staff and IT administrators.

## Do I need to create a new username or password?

**No.** Use the same personal email address that received your SHHA invitation (for example, your Gmail, Yahoo Mail, Outlook.com, or iCloud address).

- **If that email is already a Microsoft account** (e.g., any @outlook.com, @hotmail.com, or @live.com address, or a personal email you previously registered with Microsoft), sign in with its existing password.
- **If that email is not a Microsoft account**, Microsoft will either send you a **one-time passcode** by email each time you sign in, or prompt you to create a free Microsoft account. Either way, you do not need a separate SHHA-specific username or password.

## Can I share a file directly to the committee mailing list from SharePoint?

**Not reliably** when the committee group includes external (guest) members, which most SHHA groups do. SharePoint's built-in "Share" dialog sometimes cannot resolve external-member group addresses, and recipients may get "Access Denied" errors.

**Use this reliable method instead:**

1. **Upload your file to the committee's SharePoint document library.**
   - Open the SharePoint site link your committee uses.
   - Click **Upload** → **Files**, then select your file.
2. **Copy a sharing link for the file.**
   - Select the file (click the circle icon next to its name).
   - Click the **Share** button at the top of the page.
   - In the sharing dialog, click **Copy link**. Make sure the link setting says something like *"People in Sandia Homeowners with the link can edit"* (or *"can view"*). If you need to change this, click the gear icon next to "Copy link" to adjust permissions.
   - Click **Copy** to save the link to your clipboard.
3. **Email the link to the committee mailing list.**
   - Open your personal email (Gmail, Yahoo Mail, Outlook.com, etc.).
   - Compose a new message to the committee address (e.g., `csc@sandiahomeowners.org`).
   - Paste the SharePoint link into the email body. Add a brief description of the file.
   - Click **Send**.

## Why should I send links instead of attachments?

Sending a SharePoint link instead of an email attachment is important because:

- **One official version.** Everyone views and edits the same file. No one ends up working on an outdated copy.
- **Less confusion.** There are no multiple versions floating around in different inboxes.
- **Centralized records.** The file stays in the committee's SharePoint library, where future volunteers and officers can find it.
- **No file-size limits.** Email attachments can bounce if they are too large. SharePoint links have no such problem.

**Rule of thumb:** If a document is SHHA committee business, it goes in SharePoint, and you email the link. Only use attachments for quick, one-off items that do not need to be retained (e.g., a casual photo).

> **Microsoft help:** [External or guest sharing in SharePoint](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/external-or-guest-sharing-in-onedrive-sharepoint-and-lists-7aa070b8-d094-4921-9dd9-86392f2a79e7) explains how sharing works when external guests are involved.

## I have a role mailbox (e.g., president@, treasurer@). Should I reply from my personal inbox?

**For SHHA business, always reply from the role mailbox** (e.g., `president@sandiahomeowners.org`, `treasurer@sandiahomeowners.org`), or at minimum **CC the role mailbox** so the message is saved there.

Why this matters: role mailboxes stay with the position, not the person. When leadership changes, the next officer inherits the full email history. If you replied only from your personal inbox, those records are lost to the organization.

**How to reply from the role mailbox using Outlook on the web:**

1. Go to [outlook.office.com](https://outlook.office.com) and sign in with your **SHHA licensed account** (your `@sandiahomeowners.org` address, not your personal email).
2. In the left sidebar, look under **"Shared with me"** (or right-click your account name and choose **"Add shared folder or mailbox"**, then type the role address, e.g., `president@sandiahomeowners.org`).
3. Open the email you want to reply to from the role mailbox's Inbox.
4. Click **Reply**. Check the **From** field — it should show the role address. If it shows your personal address instead, click **From** and select the role mailbox address.
5. Compose and click **Send**. The recipient will see the message came from the role address.

## I cannot see my shared role inbox in Outlook. What should I do?

If the shared mailbox does not appear automatically, try adding it manually:

**In Outlook on the web** ([outlook.office.com](https://outlook.office.com)):

1. Sign in with your SHHA `@sandiahomeowners.org` account.
2. In the left folder pane, right-click your account name.
3. Select **"Add shared folder or mailbox."**
4. Type the role mailbox address (e.g., `cscchair@sandiahomeowners.org`) and press Enter.
5. The shared mailbox should now appear under **"Shared with me"** in the folder pane.

**In the new Outlook desktop app** (Windows or Mac):

1. Open Outlook and go to **Mail**.
2. In the left folder pane, right-click your account name.
3. Select **"Add shared folder or mailbox."**
4. Type the role mailbox address and click **Add**.

**If it still does not appear**, your account may not have been granted permission to the shared mailbox yet. Contact **ITHelp@sandiahomeowners.org** and ask them to verify your mailbox permissions.

## Where should Board materials be submitted?

**Upload directly to the Board's SharePoint site** using the direct link provided in your Board materials or by ITHelp.

**Step by step:**

1. Open the Board SharePoint link in your web browser (you do not need to install anything).
2. Navigate to the appropriate folder (e.g., "Meeting Materials", "Agendas", etc.).
3. Click **Upload** → **Files** and select the document from your computer.
4. Once uploaded, copy the sharing link (see the file-sharing steps above) and email it to the Board mailing list if you need to notify members.

Only deviate from this process if office staff specifically requests you to submit materials a different way (e.g., emailing the document directly to them).

---

## Why am I not getting Board reminder emails?

Board meeting reminders are sent automatically from a **shared Google Calendar** workflow, not from Microsoft 365. Common reasons you might not be receiving them:

- **Check your Spam / Junk folder.** Automated calendar reminders often get filtered.
- **Verify your email address is correct** in the Google Calendar sharing settings. If you recently changed your email, the reminders may be going to your old address.
- **Confirm you accepted the Google Calendar invitation.** You may have received a separate calendar-sharing email from Google that needs to be accepted.

If none of the above resolves it, contact **office staff** or **ITHelp@sandiahomeowners.org** to have them verify you are included in the Board calendar.

## Where do I log in?

There is **no single Microsoft website for everything.** Which site you use depends on what you need to do:

| What you need to do | Where to go | Who uses it |
|---|---|---|
| **Open committee files** | Your committee's **SharePoint link** (provided by your chair or ITHelp). You can also browse SharePoint at [sandiahomeowners.sharepoint.com](https://sandiahomeowners.sharepoint.com) | All volunteers |
| **Read/send role mailbox email** | [outlook.office.com](https://outlook.office.com) — sign in with your `@sandiahomeowners.org` account | Officers and chairs with role mailboxes |
| **Manage your Microsoft account** | [account.microsoft.com](https://account.microsoft.com) — for things like resetting your password or updating security info | Anyone with a Microsoft account |
| **Access personal OneDrive files** | [onedrive.live.com](https://onedrive.live.com) (personal) or your SharePoint site's document library (SHHA files) | Limited use |

**Tip for most volunteers:** You will almost always just click a SharePoint link that someone emailed you or that appears in this guide. You do not need to remember a general login page.

## When should I contact IT Help?

Contact **ITHelp@sandiahomeowners.org** if:

- You **cannot access SharePoint** — you get an "Access Denied" or "You need permission" error
- You are **not receiving committee emails** at your personal address
- You **never received or cannot find** your original Microsoft invitation email
