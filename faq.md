# FAQ

Frequently asked questions for SHHA volunteers.

## I was invited but cannot access files. What is usually wrong?

Most often, the original Microsoft invitation was never accepted.

Find that invitation in your email and accept it.

## Do I need a paid Microsoft license?

Usually no.

Most volunteers are added as external Microsoft users and can participate without a paid SHHA license.

## Do I need to create a new username/password?

No.

Use the same email address that received your SHHA invitation.

## Can I share a file directly to the committee mailing list from SharePoint?

Not reliably for external-member groups.

Use this method instead:

1. Upload file to SharePoint.
2. Use **Share** or **Copy Link**.
3. Email the link to the committee list.

## Why should I send links instead of attachments?

Links preserve one official version in SharePoint, reduce confusion, and keep committee records centralized.

## I have a role mailbox. Should I reply from my personal inbox?

For SHHA business, reply from the role mailbox or CC it.

This preserves continuity for future role holders.

## I cannot see my shared role inbox in Outlook. What should I do?

Contact ITHelp to verify mailbox permissions were assigned correctly.

## Where should Board materials be submitted?

Upload directly to Board SharePoint unless office staff specifically requests otherwise.

## Why am I not getting Board reminder emails?

Reminders are automated from the shared Google Calendar workflow.

If reminders are missing, contact office staff or ITHelp.

## Where do I log in?

There is no single Microsoft website for all tasks.

You may use:

- SharePoint link (most volunteers)
- Outlook (role mailbox users)
- OneDrive (limited use)

## When should I contact IT Help?

Contact **ITHelp@sandiahomeowners.org** if:

- You cannot access SharePoint
- You are not receiving committee emails
- You never accepted your invitation
- You cannot see a shared inbox
- You are unsure which email to use
- You are stuck sharing a file

Needing help is normal.
