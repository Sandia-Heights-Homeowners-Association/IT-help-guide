# Volunteer with @sandiahomeowners.org Email Address

This page is for volunteers who already have an SHHA mailbox and may also have role-based inbox access.

## What You Should Use

- Your SHHA email account for routine communication
- Committee mailing lists for group communication
- SharePoint links for committee files

## Shared Role Inbox Basics

If you hold an officer/chair role, you may be assigned a shared role inbox.

- Open it from your normal account
- Reply from the role inbox for official role business
- Keep records in the role mailbox for continuity

## File Sharing Rule

For committee documents:

1. Upload to SharePoint
2. Copy link
3. Send link to committee list

Avoid one-off attachments for files that should remain in committee records.

## If You Are Not Seeing Something

- Confirm you are signed in with your SHHA account
- Confirm your committee membership is current
- Contact **ITHelp@sandiahomeowners.org** if access is still missing
