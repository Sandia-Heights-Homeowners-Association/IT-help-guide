# Quick Start for New Volunteers

This page helps new volunteers understand how SHHA email access works on day one.

## Start Here: Which Type of Volunteer Are You?
SHHA has two volunteer categories:

1. **Volunteer without an SHHA email address**
2. **Volunteer with a role-based SHHA address**

Most volunteers are in Category 1.

## Category 1: Volunteers Who Do **Not** Get Their Own SHHA Email Address

### Who this is
- Committee members
- Project volunteers
- Most external participants

### What you get
- You are added to one or more SHHA mailing lists (Microsoft Groups), such as:
  - `csc@sandiahomeowners.org`
  - `acc@sandiahomeowners.org`
  - `shha-all@sandiahomeowners.org`
- You receive messages at your existing email address.
- You do **not** need a paid SHHA Microsoft 365 license.

### What to expect
- You can receive committee communications and announcements.
- You may reply to list emails based on group settings.
- You do not receive an SHHA mailbox login.

### If something is wrong
If you are missing messages, contact office staff so membership can be checked and updated.

## Category 2: Volunteers Who **Do** Get a Role-Based SHHA Address

### Who this is
- Volunteers serving in specific leadership roles (for example, committee chair or executive role).

### Role-based addresses are shared inboxes
Examples:
- `accchair@sandiahomeowners.org`
- `cscchair@sandiahomeowners.org`
- `president@sandiahomeowners.org`
- `vicepresident@sandiahomeowners.org`
- `secretary@sandiahomeowners.org`
- `treasurer@sandiahomeowners.org`

These addresses are tied to the **role**, not the person.

### Important access rule
- You do not sign in directly as the role address.
- Access is granted to your own licensed account.
- You open the shared mailbox from your normal account.

### What to expect
- Your successor will inherit the same role mailbox when your term ends.
- Historical messages stay with the role mailbox for continuity.

### If something is wrong
If you cannot open the role mailbox, ask staff/IT admin to verify permissions.

## Who Maintains This
- Group membership updates: Anna (staff)
- Technical escalation and access troubleshooting: IT admin
