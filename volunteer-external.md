# Volunteer without sandiahomeowners.org Email Address

This page is for volunteers who participate using a personal email address.

You usually do **not** need a paid Microsoft license.

## First-Week Setup

1. Find and accept the Microsoft invitation sent to your personal email
2. Use that same email when prompted to sign in
3. Open your committee SharePoint link
4. Confirm you receive committee mailing list messages

## What You Can Expect

- You can receive committee group email
- You can open SharePoint documents you were granted access to
- You may see references to Microsoft tools SHHA does not use (safe to ignore)

## Most Common Mistakes

- Not accepting the invitation
- Trying to share files directly with groups instead of sharing links
- Sending attachments when the file belongs in SharePoint

## Correct File Sharing Pattern

1. Upload to SharePoint
2. Copy link
3. Email link to committee list

## Need Help?

Contact **ITHelp@sandiahomeowners.org** if you cannot access files or receive committee messages.
