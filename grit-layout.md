Download all emailed images into the `Images` folder.

## Skeleton and Layout Setup
### Ensure all guides are visible
- `View → Grids & Guides → Show Guides`
- `View → Screen Mode → Normal`

### Insert pages

### Insert ads and images
- Use ads in planned ad frames.
- Use `Cmd+Shift+Click` to turn a frame from the master into an editable box.
- Use `Cmd+D` to place the image.

### Image fitting behavior
- The image masters are created with an Object Style that fits the image you place into the largest dimension.
