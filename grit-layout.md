## Monthly Steps
- [ ] Copy the template into the month folder.
- [ ] Rename the file for the current month.

## Monthly Settings
### Change monthly accent color
- In InDesign: `Window → Color → Swatches`
- Select **Issue Accent Color**.
- Enter RGB value, or use the eyedropper tool.

## Folder Structure
Your local folder structure should look like this:

```text
month_name
  - Ads
  - Images
```

## Download Assets
### Ads
Download prepared ads from OneDrive.

Example path:
- `Communication & Publication Committee > Documents > GRIT Editor Workspace > Monthly Issues > 2026 > March > Ads`

### Images
Download all emailed images into the `Images` folder.

## Skeleton and Layout Setup
### Ensure all guides are visible
- `View → Grids & Guides → Show Guides`
- `View → Screen Mode → Normal`

### Insert pages
- Insert enough pages so the issue ends on a multiple of 4.

### Insert ads and images
- Use ads in planned ad frames.
- Use `Cmd+Shift+Click` to turn a frame from the master into an editable box.
- Use `Cmd+D` to place the image.

### Image fitting behavior
- The image masters are created with an Object Style that fits the image you place into the largest dimension.

## GRIT Layout FAQ

### Do I need to use exact folder names?
Yes. Keep the month folder with `Ads` and `Images` subfolders so links and placement are predictable.

### Why does Cmd+Shift+Click matter?
It unlocks master-page frames so you can edit a specific issue page without changing the master itself.

### What if page count is not a multiple of 4?
Insert pages until the total is divisible by 4. Print layout and booklet flow depend on this.
